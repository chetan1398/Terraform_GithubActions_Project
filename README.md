# Terraform Infrastructure Automation with GitHub Actions

## Introduction
This GitHub repository provides a comprehensive guide and resources to create and manage infrastructure using Terraform and to automate the deployment process using GitHub Actions. The combination of these tools allows for efficient infrastructure as code practices and robust CI/CD workflows.

## Tools
1. **Terraform** - An open-source infrastructure as code software tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language.
2. **GitHub Actions** - A powerful automation platform that enables you to automate your workflow directly from your GitHub repository.

## Features
- **Define Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Define your infrastructure components such as virtual machines, databases, networks, etc., in a Terraform configuration file.
- **Automate Deployment**: Utilize GitHub Actions workflows to automatically deploy your infrastructure whenever there are changes to the Terraform configuration files.
- **Version Control**: Keep your infrastructure code version-controlled in GitHub, allowing for effective collaboration among team members.
- **Best Practices**: Implement best practices for infrastructure as code, including versioning, code reviews, and comprehensive documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A GitHub account
- Terraform installed on your local machine
- Basic knowledge of YAML for GitHub Actions workflows

### Setup
1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**:
   - Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

2. **Configure Terraform**:
   - Navigate to the Terraform directory in your local project.
   - Update the Terraform configuration files according to your infrastructure requirements.

3. **Configure GitHub Actions**:
   - Navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory.
   - Edit the existing workflow files or create new ones to meet your deployment needs.

### Usage
- **Running Terraform**:
  - Initialize the Terraform environment:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
  - Plan the deployment to see the changes:
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```
  - Apply the changes to create or update your infrastructure:
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

- **Automating Deployments with GitHub Actions**:
  - Push your changes to GitHub:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update infrastructure"
    git push origin main
    ```
  - Monitor the Actions tab in GitHub to see the deployment process.
